which is either Good, Neutral or Bad.

Example of usage:

```
> view savings

Transferred $10.00 from emergency fund to vacation
```

#### Setting Savings Goals: `savings goal set`

Edits the savings goal description. Note: If there are 2 saving entries with 
the same amount in the saving list, this command will only set the
goal of the first saving entry to the provided goal. However, if user
would like to change the saving goal of the second/third... saving entry
with the same amount, they may consider using command "savings goal update",
which is shown below.

Format: `savings goal set <AMOUNT> / <DESCRIPTION>`

* `<AMOUNT>` is the target amount for your savings goal.
* `<DESCRIPTION>` is a description of what you're saving for.

Example of usage:

```
> savings goal set 500 / new laptop
Savings goal set: $500.00 for new laptop
```

#### Updating Savings Goals: `savings goal update`

Updates an existing savings goal. One difference between this command 
and "savings goal set" is this command can also update the amount, even
though it is not that obvious to see in the command ("savings goal update")
that it can also update amount.

Format: `savings goal update <INDEX> <AMOUNT> / <DESCRIPTION>`

* `<INDEX>` refers to the index number shown in the savings goals list.
* `<AMOUNT>` is the new target amount.
* `<DESCRIPTION>` is the new description.

Example of usage:

```
> savings goal update 1 600 / gaming laptop
Updated savings goal: $600.00 for gaming laptop
```

#### Deleting Savings Goals: `savings goal delete`

Removes a savings goal.

Format: `savings goal delete <INDEX>`

* `<INDEX>` refers to the index number shown in the savings goals list.

Example of usage:

```
> savings goal delete 1
Deleted savings goal: $600.00 for gaming laptop(now the saving goal for this entry is empty)
```

### Summary Management

#### View Summary: `view summary`

Displays a summary of your current financial status, including total income, expenses, available balance, and savings.

Format: `view summary`

Example of usage: 

```
> view summary
===== BUDGET SUMMARY =====
Total Income:         $150.00
Total Expenses:       $75.00
Available Balance:    $75.00
Total Savings:        $30.00
===========================
```

#### Detailed Financial Tracking

The Summary component maintains your financial data using these calculations:
- Available Funds = Total Income - Total Expenses
- All calculations are performed automatically when you add or remove entries

#### Data Validation

The Summary component includes built-in validation to ensure financial data integrity:
- All amounts (income, expenses, savings) must be positive numbers
- You cannot remove more income than your current total
- You cannot add expenses or remove income that would result in negative available funds
- You cannot remove more income, expenses or savings than currently recorded

#### Financial Calculations

The Summary component automatically:
- Recalculates available funds after every transaction
- Updates all observers (like the alert system) when financial data changes
- Maintains running totals for all financial categories
- Ensures data consistency across the application

### Alert System

#### Low Funds Alert System

Common Cents includes a low funds alert feature that warns you when your available funds fall below a set threshold.

#### Set Alert Threshold: `alert set`

Sets the threshold for low funds alerts. When your available funds drop below this amount, Common Cents will display a warning. Threshold is automatically rounded to 2 decimal places for values more than 2 decimal places (E.g. 0.004 will be rounded down to 0.00).

_Note: There should only be a single whitespace between `alert` and `set`_.

Format: `alert set <AMOUNT>`

* `<AMOUNT>` must be a positive number.
* The default threshold is $5.00 if not explicitly set.

Example of usage:

```
> alert set 20
Funds alert threshold set to $20.00
```

#### Alert Trigger

When your available funds drop below the set threshold due to adding expenses, Common Cents will automatically display a warning:

```
> add expense 40 / groceries / F

====== ALERT ======
WARNING: Available funds ($10.00) are below warning threshold ($20.00)
===================

Added expense: [FOOD] $40.0 for groceries
```

#### Alert System Implementation

The alert system:
- Uses an observer pattern to monitor financial changes
- Has a default threshold of $5.00
- Can be customized to any positive amount
- Shows warnings immediately when funds drop below the threshold

#### Alert System Features

The FundsAlert component provides these additional features:
- **Initial Notification**: Displays information about the alert feature when you start the application
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously checks your financial status after every transaction
- **Customizable Threshold**: Allows you to set a warning level that matches your financial comfort zone
- **Clear Visual Warnings**: Displays prominent alerts when your funds drop below the threshold

### Help Display: `help`

Shows a list of all available commands and their formats.

Format: `help`

Example of usage:

## Features coming soon

### Local Saving to Disk

**Planned Feature:** We plan to implement functionality to save all financial data (income, expenses, savings, alert settings) locally to a file on the user's disk. This will allow users to persist their data between application sessions.

**Reason for Delay:** Implementing local storage requires careful consideration of file formats, data serialization, error handling (e.g., corrupted files), and user experience for loading/saving data. We prioritized the development of core functionalities like tracking income/expenses, managing savings, viewing summaries, and setting alerts to deliver a functional baseline product first. The effort required for robust local saving was deferred to focus on these essential features.

## Error Messages

Common Cents provides helpful error messages to guide you when something goes wrong:

* **Invalid command:**
  * If you enter an unrecognized command, Common Cents will suggest using the help command.
  * Example: `hello` → `Oops! I don't recognize that command. Type 'help' to see available commands.`

* **Invalid command format:**
  * If you enter a command with incorrect formatting, Common Cents will explain the proper format.
  * Example: `add income 50` → `Invalid format for 'add income' command. Please use 'add income <AMOUNT> / <SOURCE>'`

* **Negative amount:**
  * If you try to add a negative amount, Common Cents will remind you that amounts must be positive.
  * Example: `add income -50 / salary` → `Income amount must be greater than zero.`

* **Insufficient funds:**
  * If you try to add expenses more than your available balance, Common Cents will warn you.
  * Example: `add expense 100 / vacation / B` when you only have $50 available → `Error adding expense: Cannot add this expense as it would exceed your available funds. Available balance: 0.0`

* **Invalid index:**
  * If you try to delete an entry with an invalid index, Common Cents will inform you.
  * Example: `delete income 10` when you only have 2 income entries → `Invalid index. Please provide a valid income index between 1 and 2.`
